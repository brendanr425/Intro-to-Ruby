Exception handling is used to deal with unpredictable input. If input of a specific type is expected within the program, a 'rescue' statement can be used to handle certain exceptions. An example of exception handling is when a program expects a string as input but gets an integer instead. If an integer is input into the program, a rescue statement can be used to prevent a TypeError, which means that it will execute any subsequent code without breaking the program.
